# @gjsify/generate-deno-op-methods

This script is designed to generate Deno operation (starting with `op_`) method skeletons from Rust code, utilizing Language Model Libraries (LLMs). The primary objective is to simplify the process of reimplementing these methods in GJS, ultimately facilitating the integration of the Deno Runtime within the GJS environment.

## Usage

```sh
deno task start
```

## TODO

* Switch to Ollama
* Find example usage of the op methods
* Validate the generated code
* Add an option how many methods to generate
